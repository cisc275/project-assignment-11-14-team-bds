# Spring 2019 Team 11-14 Project

This is the repo for Team 11-14's project, which consists of two separate games in one Java program:
1. A game in which you play as an Osprey migrating from South America. You travel north, collecting fish and powerups while trying to stay on the correct path.
2. A game in which you play as a Clapper Rail, scurrying around a marsh as you find food and try to avoid predators.

Each game will be selectable from a main menu and can be played in any order.
